1. write a shell script function that take name of a file or directory as unlimited argument and reports if it is a regular file, a directory, or another type of file. 
Also perform an ls command against the file or directory with the long listing option. Write for all the mention details . also create function function “file_count” and call it in your script. If you use variable in your function, remember to make it a local variable. [5]


Sol---

function file_info {
local file_name=$1
if [ -f "$file_name" ]
then
echo "$file_name is a regular file"
elif [ -d "$file_name" ]
then
echo "$file_name is a directory"
else
echo "$file_name is another type of file"
fi
ls -l $file_name
}

function file_count {
local dir_name=$1
local count=$(ls -1 $dir_name | wc -l)
echo "Number of files in $dir_name: $count"
}

for arg in "$@"; do
file_info $arg
if [ -d "$arg" ]
then
file_count $arg
fi
done



2. You need to find a file named myfile.txt somewhere in your Linux file system. Which is thecorrect command to do this? [2]

Sol---
     ---The basic command is -find [path]
   -- find . -name "myfile.txt"  // myfile.txt is file name 
----find /home -type f -iname "myfile.txt"  // type -f option to only search for files .



3. Write a scipt to Lock down the file or directory permission for folder1 files as per following requirement  [8]
mkdir folder1
touch f_{1..3}

.file.sh folder1/

-------------------

if [ $# -eq 0 ]
then
echo "Please provide directory name as an argument"
exit 1
fi


dir_name=$1


for file in $dir_name/*; do
chmod 700 $file
done

echo "Permissions for all files in $dir_name have been set to 700"

--------------------





Remove all permissions for groups and others.
Provide directory name through command-line.
After running script all files in the given directory, Only should have all the permissions.
But remember dont add any permission to user only change to others and groups.
